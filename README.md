JavaScript

A scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia,
animate images, and pretty much everything else.
(Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)


# HTML

The markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example 
defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.


# CSS

A language of style rules that we use to apply styling to 
our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
